\description{
This dataset contains information on substructures and Electrospray adducts/
artefacts manually curated from literature sources. 
The variables are as follows:
}
\details{
\itemize{
 \item Entry_no.  substructure number (1 -- 268)          
 \item SubStructure. numeric logical (0 and 1) is the entry a fragment/neutral
 loss substructure.       
 \item ESI_adduct.  numeric logical (0 and 1) is the entry an atmospheric 
 pressure/ electrospray adduct.          
 \item SubStructure_type. parent substructure type (e.g. sulfate, glucuronide) 
 \item Abbrev_name. abbreviated name of substructure type within square 
 brackets. This abbreviated version can be displayed more easily within a 
 results table for instance (e.g. [PC_184]).       
 \item name. Full descriptive name of the neutral loss/ fragment/ electrospray
 adduct within a square bracket (e.g. [NAcCysteine Acetamide]).              
 \item IUPAC. IUPAC name for fragment/ neutral loss.               
 \item SMILES. Canonical SMILES code of fragment/ neutral losses.             
 \item molecular_formula. Molecular formula of fragment/ neutral losses.           
 \item monoisotopic_weight. Monoisotopic weight of fragment/ neutral losses.
 (0.9840156 -- 388.0853100)
 \item Neut_loss. numeric logical (0 and 1) is the entry a neutral loss.             
 \item frag. numeric logical (0 and 1) is the entry a fragment.               
 \item pos. numeric logical (0 and 1) is the entry found in positive mode.                 
 \item neg. numeric logical (0 and 1) is the entry found in negative mode.                
 \item mass_shift. the expected monoisotopic mass shift associated with this
 substructure/ adduct type. (17.02655 -- 360.12678)   
 \item ref. the literature reference for the entry.
